Tower of Power is a solo project that I created in 4 days for the GTMK game jam! The theme was "Built to Scale" which I interpreted by making a tower game where you literally build your tower to scale as tall as possible.

Here are my most notable accomplishments with this project
  - I worked on all of the programming, pixel art, and game design (what little of it there is). The background music is the only asset I sourced externally.
  - I reused some Health, Hitbox, and Hurtbox components that I developed for a previous project. Creating clean code allowed me to reuse this functionality without issue!
  - Developed a SpriteEffects shader that I used for a LOT of polishing on the enemies. Ex: they flash white when hit, lose saturation in their death animation.

Note: My asset hierarchy organization on this is kind of unconventional. Assets are organized conceptually rather than by file type,
so instead of all scripts being in the scripts, all sprites being in a sprites folder, etc... the assets are instead lumped together with
what entity they are associated with.
